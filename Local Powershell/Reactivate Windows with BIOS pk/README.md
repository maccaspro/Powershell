## Reactive Windows using original PK from BIOS

This can cure many activation issues, especially licensed promotions to Windows Enterprise from user licences, the underlying Windows Pro must be valid and activated first to allow promotion.

Open the reactivatewindows.ps1 script and run line by line in admin powershell to reactivate from BIOS product key.

If machine didn't come with product key pre-installed, then no pk will show and this method won't be possible.
