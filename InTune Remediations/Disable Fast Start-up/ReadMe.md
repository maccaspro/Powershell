## Disable Fast Start-up

This is a simple remediation to detect if Fast Start-up is enabled, and if so, disable it.  This is useful for nearly all machines now, as most are on fast nvme storage and don't benefit greatly from the fast start-up time saving like old HDD would, and by disabling it, a machine does a full restart with every shutdown.  Across a company this has demonstrably reduced support calls.
